Rust Command Line Enthusiasts
=============================

[Rust][rust-lang] libraries and tools, managed *by the community for the
community*.

**Contributors, maintainers, and projects are very welcome to join this
organization!**

This organization is not in competition with organizations like [rust-cli][] or
[clap-rs][]. On the contrary, it would be welcomed if any of the projects
maintained here would be elevated to either of these organizations.


Goals
-----

1.  Promote Rust on the command line, just like [rust-cli][] does.
1.  Increase the [bus factor][] of community-managed projects.
